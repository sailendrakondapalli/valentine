export const loveLetterContent = `My Dearest Love,

As I sit here writing this, my heart is overflowing with emotions that words can barely capture. You have become the most beautiful part of my life, the reason I wake up with a smile, and the last thought that brings me peace before I sleep.

From the moment we met, you've filled my world with colors I never knew existed. Your laughter is my favorite melody, your smile my greatest treasure, and your love the most precious gift I've ever received.

Every day with you feels like a new adventure, a new page in our beautiful story. You've taught me what it means to love unconditionally, to find joy in the simplest moments, and to believe in the magic of "us."

I love the way you scrunch your nose when you're thinking, how you get excited about little things, and how you make everyone around you feel special. But most of all, I love how you've made me believe in forever.

You are my best friend, my greatest love, and my favorite person in the entire world. I promise to cherish every moment we have together, to support your dreams, and to love you more with each passing day.

Thank you for being you, for choosing us, and for making my life infinitely better just by being in it.

Forever and always yours,
Your devoted partner ❤️`;
